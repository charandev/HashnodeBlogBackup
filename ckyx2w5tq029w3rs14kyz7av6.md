## 3 bad habits you should avoid as a developer

I've been preoccupied with a lot of things lately, so I haven't been able to write blogs as frequently as I used to. However, I never stopped coding because it is what allows me to eat!

I believe that there are a few behaviors that we should develop right away when learning a new procedure. Otherwise, picking it up in the middle is quite difficult. As a programmer, there are always numerous best practices that I know would make me stand out from the crowd if I followed them from the start, but I was unable to do so since I was not accustomed to them from the start.

Today, I'll try to convince you to practice three habits that I've always wanted to adopt!

## 1. Commenting Code

You might think that commenting code won't have much of an impact. Especially if your project develops in size and you need to revisit a method you wrote in a different component after a long period of time. You will be irritated, believe me! You won't even remember that you wrote the code.

It will take you 10 seconds to comment code, but it will save you 10 hours if you return to the same block in two months. Despite the fact that I have encountered this circumstance numerous times, I still feel guilty about it.

It also helps you stand out among your coworkers. This type of code will not be encountered frequently by your manager or clients. Even if you quit the organization for some reason, a new developer who replaces you will have an easy time. It is critical, and I cannot emphasize this enough. If you're going to start doing this, let us know in the comments!


## 2. Documenting Work

This is a must-have habit if you work in a software company as a developer implementing many features, several bug fixes, and many more improvements sprint by sprint. Everything in the profession is based on self-evaluation and manager feedback. They will have a direct impact on your development. So, if you have one-on-one feedback sessions with your manager, you should have all of your work from the previous years/months in hand to demonstrate it.

This is why documenting your effort is very much essential. As time passes, we tend to forget our accomplishments or important features that we worked on. I use Notion to document my work so that it will be very easy for me to refer to all of my accomplishments, projects I worked on, and problems I fixed anytime someone asks me what I did at work.

It's also a good idea to keep your resume updated with new information on a regular basis.


## 3. Never Stop Improving Yourself

There will come a moment when a developer believes I know everything I need to know in order to execute my job. This prevents him from learning new things and expanding his ideas. This is a highly dangerous position since it will not only prevent you from learning anything, but it will also put you behind thousands of other developers who are acquiring new skills and switching companies for better pay.

It also holds true for microprocesses. For example, thinking how to improve how you code constantly with new features supported by languages.  Nothing is easy to learn, but having the appropriate attitude toward learning new things every day adds up over time, and you will see a difference in yourself.

------------------------------------------------------

So, the moral of the story is that nothing happens overnight, and the simple things we do on a daily basis will define us and help us become better developers in the future.
